If you stop using the Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity.<br/><br/>
We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the Rules, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account.<br/>
In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that sections shall continue to apply.<br/>

10.Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability<br/><br/>
Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Coolpa and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Coolpa Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.<br/><br/>
A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"<br/><br/>
Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE COOLPA ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.<br/>

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Coolpa Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.<br/><br/>
B. Links<br/><br/>
The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Coolpa Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Coolpa Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.<br/><br/>
C. Limitation of Liability<br/><br/>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COOLPA ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.<br/>
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE COOLPA ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID COOLPA, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.<br/>
THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COOLPA ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.<br/><br/>
11. General Terms<br/><br/>
A. Waiver and Severability<br/><br/>
The failure of Coolpa to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.<br/><br/>
B. Entire Agreement<br/><br/>
These Terms, the Rules and our Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement between Coolpa and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Coolpa that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Coolpa and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Coolpa is the parent, no other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.<br/>
We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at http://coolpa.net/terms. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via an “<a href="/users/coolpa">:coolpa</a>” update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
